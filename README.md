# AntiRat

### Instructions
Run the jar file and follow along. You will be given the option whether you wish to delete a mod or not as they can sometimes false flag.

### Disclaimer
This is not 100% accurate and will not always protect you. Use this along with common sense to make up your mind whether a mod is worth using or not. Please also know that some of the 'red flag' functions are used by some mods for authentication, so please do not automatically assume a mod is a rat because it flagged a couple checks. This is most useful for mods that are not well known and verifiably legitimate.
